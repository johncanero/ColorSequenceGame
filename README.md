# Simon Game Challenge

Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer
and Howard J. Morrison, working for a toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates
, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones
and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

This is the Color Sequence Game (Improved Interface)
